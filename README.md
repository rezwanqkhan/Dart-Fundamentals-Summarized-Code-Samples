## Functions

Dart supports both named and anonymous functions. Functions are first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments and returned from other functions.

## Lists

Lists in Dart are ordered collections of elements. They can dynamically grow or shrink and support various operations like indexing, adding, removing, and iterating.

## Inheritance

Dart supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit properties and methods from a single superclass. This facilitates code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure in object-oriented programming.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This promotes flexibility and modularity in code design.

## Constructors

Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects. Dart provides various types of constructors, including default, named, and parameterized constructors.

## Maps

Maps in Dart are collections of key-value pairs. They provide efficient data storage and retrieval, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Loops

Dart supports traditional for loops, for-in loops, and while loops for iterating over collections and performing repetitive tasks.

## Constants

Constants in Dart are values that remain unchanged throughout the program's execution. Dart offers two types of constants: `const` for compile-time constants and `final` for runtime constants.

## Enums

Enums in Dart are a way to represent a fixed number of constant values. They provide type safety and readability, especially in scenarios where a variable can only take on a limited set of values.

## Ternary Operator

The ternary operator in Dart provides a concise way to write conditional expressions. It evaluates a boolean condition and returns one of two expressions based on the result.

## Mixins

Mixins are a way to reuse code in multiple class hierarchies. They allow the composition of classes with additional functionality without the need for inheritance.
